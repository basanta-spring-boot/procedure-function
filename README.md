### Stored Procedure Use Case: Complex Business Logic
Imagine a Spring Boot application for order management. You want to process an order by:
```
1. Validating stock levels.
2. Deducting quantities from inventory.
3. Recording the transaction in the database.
```
A stored procedure is ideal here since it can handle multiple database operations in a single call.
